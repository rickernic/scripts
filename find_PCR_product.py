#writing a program to find 500 bp fragments in blast file

#Adina created the blast file and put them in order
#in R I added a column that gave the difference between two adjacent rows

#need to find the ~500 bp fragments
#and output both that row and the one before it to get both primers

#originally run on hmp_with_diff file; then mock_imperfect file

#finally on usda mock file but changed to 400-600 (from 300-700)-still hundreds
